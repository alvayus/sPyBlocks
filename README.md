# Neural Logic Blocks

This repository contains an open source Python package that provides researchers with a new toolkit of Spiking Neural Networks (SNN)-based building blocks that emulate the behavior of associated digital components. Therefore, these spiking blocks are useful for developing bio-inspired applications, which can be very useful especially for neuromorphic engineers.

The set of blocks contained in this repository arises from a series of works, which is as follows:

- Spike-based building blocks for performing logic operations using Spiking Neural Networks on SpiNNaker. International Joint Conference on Neural Networks. Padua, Italy, 2022.
